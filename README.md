Seema, a working professional, finds a room listed near her workplace. After reviewing the amenities and rent, she signs up, verifies her account, and books the room ‚Äî all within the platform. She receives confirmation via the admin dashboard.

3. Room Listing by Local Owners
Karan owns a few vacant rooms in his village. He registers as an admin, logs in to the dashboard, and lists his rooms with images, rent, and availability. Within days, he gets booking requests from verified clients.

4. Students Searching for Affordable Housing
A group of students looking for shared, low-cost accommodation use the app to explore multiple listings in their university‚Äôs rural outreach program area. They use tags like ‚Äúshared‚Äù, ‚Äústudents only‚Äù, and ‚Äúmeals included‚Äù to filter results.

5. Family Relocation from City to Village
A small family relocating from the city for seasonal work uses the platform to find temporary housing. The user-friendly interface and local language support help them navigate listings with ease.

## Admin Use Cases

The admin logs in and accesses the dashboard to add new room listings. They input details like rent, location, availability, and upload images. They can also edit or delete existing listings as needed.

Whenever a customer sends a booking request, the admin receives a notification. From the admin panel, they can view all pending requests, approve or reject them, and send confirmation messages.

3. User and Inquiry Management
Admins can view all registered users, monitor their activity, and respond to customer inquiries. This ensures smooth communication between room seekers and property owners.

4. Content Moderation
To maintain platform quality, the admin reviews content such as room descriptions, uploaded photos, and user-submitted feedback to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.
